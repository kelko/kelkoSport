Pebble App for my sport cycle

How it works
-----------------

The app has 4 modes:

* Idle (Default, Indefinite)
* Prepare (5 sec)
* Go! (45 or 30 sec)
* Pause (90 or 60 sec)

Basic usage:

- When in Idle or Pause click on middle button to go into Prepare
- When in Prepare or Go! click on middle button to go into Idle
- When in Prepare or Go! click on upper button to restart Prepare
- When in Pause click on upper button to add 45 (or 30) seconds to timer
- When in Pause or Idle click on lower button to switch between 45 and 30 seconds

After Pause app goes to Idle automatically.
